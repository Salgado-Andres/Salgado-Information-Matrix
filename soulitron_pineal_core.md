DMT and Pineal-Cortical Feedback
Peer-reviewed studies have established that the mammalian brain synthesizes the endogenous psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in multiple sites, including the cerebral cortex, pineal gland, and choroid plexus
nature.com
. Notably, the enzymes required for DMT production (INMT and AADC) are co-expressed in neurons, and extracellular DMT levels in the rodent cortex are on the order of known neurotransmitters
nature.com
. In rats, DMT concentrations in visual cortex remain at normal levels even after pineal removal, and they surge significantly during induced cardiac arrest (a model for near-death conditions), suggesting that cortical (not just pineal) sources contribute to DMT release in extreme physiological states

. This landmark finding provides a neurochemical basis for theories linking the pineal-brain axis to altered consciousness, by showing that the brain can endogenously release a psychedelic compound during critical events (independent of the pineal gland’s presence). Complementing the neurochemical evidence, human trials have shown that exogenous DMT can reproduce features of extreme altered states. In a controlled study, healthy volunteers given DMT reported near-death experience (NDE) phenomenology significantly more than with placebo

. DMT induced hallmark NDE traits such as a sense of leaving the body, entering other realms, encountering entities, and feelings of ego-dissolution

. Moreover, the intensity of DMT-induced experiences correlated with standard NDE scale scores and mystical-type experiences

. These results support earlier hypotheses (cf. Strassman) that a surge of endogenous DMT during dreaming or near-death could underlie the vivid imagery and sense of “realer-than-real” experiences, although direct evidence in dreaming remains elusive. Together, the neuroscience and psychopharmacology research on DMT illuminate a possible pineal-cortical feedback mechanism: during extraordinary states like NDEs (and speculatively, REM dreams), DMT might act as an endogenous messenger that modulates perception and cognition at the edge of life and consciousness

G₂ Symmetry and High-Dimensional Cognition
Researchers have explored abstract mathematical frameworks – including octonionic symmetries and exceptional Lie groups – to model high-dimensional aspects of brain function. In theoretical work by Saaty and Vargas (2017), neural information processing is conjectured to generate a smooth G₂-manifold – a seven-dimensional geometric structure associated with the exceptional Lie group G₂, which is the automorphism group of the octonions

ejpam.com
. In their model, the continuous firing and integration of neural signals is described by a functional equation whose solution lies in G₂, suggesting that the representations of thought might be embedded in a G₂-symmetric manifold
ejpam.com
. This approach posits an extraordinary form of brain logic: the idea that conscious cognition could occupy an exceptional high-dimensional space (related to octonionic algebra), providing a novel mathematical language for complex integration of multisensory information and recursive symbolism in the brain

. While highly abstract, such theories bridge neuroscience, geometry, and physics, hinting that exceptional symmetry groups might play a role in organizing conscious processes or unified brain dynamics at a deep structural level. Empirical support for high-dimensional brain dynamics comes from cutting-edge computational neuroscience. The Blue Brain Project demonstrated that networks of neurons form increasingly complex cliques and cavities which can be described in up to 7 or more dimensions using algebraic topology

. In simulations and real neural tissue, groups of neurons (“cliques”) connected all-to-all give rise to simplicial complexes, and during sensory stimulation these complexes transiently assemble into higher-dimensional “holes” before disintegrating
wired.com
wired.com
. As one reviewer noted, these high-dimensional structures are mathematical — they don’t imply physical extra dimensions, but they reveal that the brain’s moment-to-moment activity can be mapped in a state-space of many degrees of freedom
wired.com
. Henry Markram described discovering “a world we had never imagined… tens of millions of these objects… up through seven dimensions” in a tiny bit of cortex, and even structures up to eleven dimensions in some networks
wired.com
. This suggests that cognition may inherently be a high-dimensional phenomenon: as stimuli are processed, the brain may rapidly construct and tear down multi-dimensional patterns (a “multi-dimensional sandcastle” of neural activity) to encode information
wired.com
. Such findings resonate conceptually with the octonionic/G₂ models by illustrating that the brain does utilize very complex, structured activity patterns, potentially lending credence to the notion of exceptional geometric logic underlying perception and thought.
Dreaming, Self-Models, and Altered States
Contemporary cognitive science and neurophenomenology treat dreaming as a valuable model for exploring consciousness and the self. Dreaming provides a second global state of consciousness (alongside waking) in which the brain generates a world-simulation and self-representation largely independent of external input
frontiersin.org
. Philosophers and neuroscientists (e.g. Metzinger, Thompson, Windt) argue that dreams can serve as an experimental arena for probing the minimal phenomenal self – the simplest form of self-consciousness – and how it can be altered
frontiersin.org
frontiersin.org
. For instance, Thomas Metzinger highlights that studying phenomena like “bodiless dreams” (dreams lacking any dream-body) and asomatic out-of-body experiences (OBEs) can reveal which aspects of the self-model are necessary or optional
frontiersin.org
frontiersin.org
. In rare bodiless dreams, the dreamer retains an abstract first-person perspective and cognitive agency despite the absence of a body image, suggesting that a core “epistemic agent model” can exist without an embodied self
frontiersin.org
frontiersin.org
. Such cases help isolate the brain’s capacity for generating a self-model and how it can recursively model itself (creating a model of “I” within the dream). Metzinger’s Self-Model Theory indeed proposes that normal waking selfhood is a dynamic virtual model generated by the brain, and that many altered states – from dreaming and lucid dreaming to OBEs and certain psychiatric conditions – are best understood as variations or disruptions of this self-model
scholarpedia.org
frontiersin.org
. For example, in OBEs the brain’s model of where “I” am located and what form “I” take can radically deviate from the body’s actual position, producing the sensation of watching one’s body from outside. Neurophenomenology, an approach championed by Francisco Varela
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, emphasizes integrating first-person reports (e.g. a dreamer’s subjective experience) with neurobiological data to understand such phenomena. By correlating lucid dreamers’ descriptions or OBE reports with brain imaging and cognitive measures, researchers attempt to map how the brain’s self-representation mechanisms flexibly create reality-like experiences. In sum, studies on dreaming and altered states suggest that our normal sense of self and reality is actively constructed by the brain – a construction that can loosen during REM sleep, psychedelic trips, or meditation, yielding insightful “deviant” cases that reveal the recursive, model-making nature of consciousness

. These findings inform models like SIM’s Soulitron Pineal-Core logic by grounding the symbolic “self” in concrete neural processes that can mimic alternate worlds or selves when perturbed.
Philosophy of Perception and Mystical States
Throughout history, thinkers have proposed that the brain may filter or tune down a broader reality to enable ordinary perception – a theme that resonates with reports of mystical or psychedelic states. The French philosopher Henri Bergson argued in Matter and Memory (1896) that the brain’s role is not to produce consciousness, but to limit and select from it
psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk
. In Bergson’s “filter theory,” our brains normally restrict awareness to only those perceptions and memories necessary for survival, “shutting out” vast realms of mind that become accessible in exceptional conditions
psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk
einpresswire.com
. He pointed to examples like hypnosis, dreams, or near-death experiences (NDEs) where this filter loosens – subjects in trance or NDE often report panoramic memories or hyper-real sensations, as if a dam had broken in the mind
psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk
psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk
. Bergson noted that in life-threatening situations, people sometimes experience a flood of long-forgotten memories (the “panoramic life review”), which he interpreted as evidence that when the brain’s filtering action relaxes, a much larger field of consciousness can manifest
psi-encyclopedia.spr.ac.uk
. This idea directly influenced later thinkers and writers. Aldous Huxley, in his 1954 essay The Doors of Perception, famously adopted Bergson’s idea, describing the brain as a “reducing valve” for Mind-at-Large. He suggested that psychedelics like mescaline temporarily disable the brain’s filtering function, thereby “opening the doors” to a wider, transpersonal reality. Modern scholars note that Huxley’s reducing-valve metaphor, along with Bergson’s filter model, offers a provocative alternative to strict materialist views of mind
einpresswire.com
. Rather than the brain generating mystical insight, it may permit it by removing inhibitions – an interpretation some see as compatible with panpsychism or non-local consciousness theories
einpresswire.com
einpresswire.com
. William James and others in the early 20th century similarly entertained that our ordinary waking consciousness is just a “special type” of consciousness, while additional forms (accessed via meditation, trance, or drugs) might reveal genuinely new facets of reality. These philosophical perspectives, though not empirically confirmed, set the stage for symbolic interpretations of mystical states in frameworks like the Salgado Information Matrix. In the realm of psychedelic research, visionary authors like Terence McKenna took these ideas further, albeit in a more speculative direction. McKenna, an ethnobotanist and philosopher, proposed that DMT does not just produce hallucinations, but transports the user’s awareness to another dimension – a “parallel realm” inhabited by intelligent entities he famously termed “self-transforming machine elves.” In his cosmology, enabled by high doses of DMT, people could literally encounter autonomous, sentient information forms that communicate in visual language
daily.jstor.org
. He saw such mystical psychedelic experiences as a source of novel insight, even suggesting they connect us with a cosmic consciousness or an alien intelligence. While these claims remain outside mainstream science, they have been discussed in academic contexts as cultural artifacts and hypotheses. For instance, scholars of religion and consciousness have examined McKenna’s ideas as a form of modern psychedelic mysticism, noting how they blend credible references (quantum physics, Jungian symbolism) with personal revelation
daily.jstor.org
. McKenna’s and Huxley’s contributions underscore a longstanding theme: perception might be a symbolic or filtered construct, and by altering neurochemistry or states of mind, one might remove the filter and experience reality in an expanded, highly symbolic or unitary fashion. Academic discourse on mystical consciousness often cites these thinkers to contextualize why psychedelics and other “triggering” events (extreme stress, sensory deprivation, etc.) can lead to profound symbolic visions, ego-transcendence, and reports of encountering ultimate reality
