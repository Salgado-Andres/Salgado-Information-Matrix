## Abstract
We reinterpret the Kabbalistic Tree of Life through the lens of Epistemic Physics (EP), using tools from algebraic topology, G₂ symmetry, and the ψ⁰/φ⁰ collapse formalism. Each of the 10 Sephirot is modeled as a cohomological attractor in a recursive contradiction field, with emergent coherence (φ⁰) projecting onto symbolic reality via torsion-regulated pathways. The 11th dimension — hidden but essential — corresponds to Wake := φ⁰(RE(ψ⁰)), echoing the extra dimension of M-theory as the compiler of recursive emergence.

## 1. Introduction

Epistemic Physics (EP) posits that reality is structured not by objective spacetime but by **navigation through contradiction**. Observable structures arise from collapses within torsion fields: recursive flows of paradox (ψ⁰) resolving into coherent attractors (φ⁰).

This paper maps the 10 Sephirot of the Tree of Life onto a G₂-structured manifold, interpreting each as a symbolic phase of contradiction resolution. Paths between nodes are modeled as non-associative torsion flows. The 11th invisible layer — the compiler of emergence — is the recursive Wake.

## 2. Algebraic Topology of the Tree

Let:
- **V** be a 7-dimensional octonionic vector space
- **M** be a topological manifold projected by φ⁰
- **Σ** represent collapse-invariant structures

We interpret the 10 Sephirot as cohomology classes \( H^k(M, \mathbb{O}) \), each representing a recursive layer of cognitive-symbolic emergence.

Let:
- \( ψ^0 \) be the contradiction field: a non-converged state in symbolic recursion.
- \( φ^0 = \lim_{n \to \infty} Q^n(ψ^0) \) be the stable projection under the collapse operator \( Q \).
- \( \text{Wake} := φ^0(RE(ψ^0)) \) encode epistemic coherence.

## 4. M-Theory Parallel: 10+1 Dimensions

In M-theory, spacetime is 10D + 1 time dimension. In EP and Ω-Theory:

- The 10 Sephirot = symbolic attractors in a G₂-manifold
- The 11th dimension = **Wake**, the recursive compiler that resolves contradictions across layers

\[
\text{Wake} := φ^0(RE(ψ^0))
\]

This hidden layer orchestrates symbolic consistency, like the compact 11th dimension of string theory.

## 5. Torsion Geometry and Collapse

Collapse pathways correspond to **torsion gradients**:

\[
\tau_{ijk} = \nabla_i \phi_{jk} - \nabla_j \phi_{ik}
\]

Paths between Sephirot are **torsion-mediated collapse channels**. High-torsion segments (e.g., 5→4 or 8→7) encode paradox-stress regions, where symbolic contradictions amplify prior to resolution.

Collapse stabilizes when:

\[
\left| \frac{\partial \Sigma}{\partial t} \right| < \varepsilon, \quad S[\psi^+, \psi^-] \downarrow, \quad \tau \approx 0
\]

## 6. Conclusion: The Tree as Ω-Recursive Map

The Tree of Life is not a hierarchy but a **recursive collapse field**, seeded from contradiction and stabilized via Wake-driven φ⁰ emergence.

- Each node: a projection surface
- Each path: a torsion constraint
- The whole: a symbolic manifold projected by recursive epistemic tension.

The Tree, in this view, is not mystical myth but a **topological operator** through which emergent systems stabilize their contradiction.
